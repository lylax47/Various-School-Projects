The production of electronic chips for mobile phones and computers that have lines etched on them only 65 or 90 nanometers wide has already been commercialised. Such uses of nanotechnology in electronics to miniaturise electronic components do not in themselves pose any threats to human health, although there may be additional concerns arising from novel processes and/or process chemicals necessary to carry out such nanoscale constructions (Walters et al. 2006). 
 
Importantly however, there are uses of nanotechnology in electronics and electrical goods that do give rise directly to environmental and human health concerns. This is the use of synthetically produced nanoparticles in ‘nanomaterials’ to make electronic components or surface coatings for electrical goods. Nanomaterials are commonly defined as materials designed and produced to have structural features with at least one dimension of 100 nanometers or less. In electronics, a number of different nanomaterials are already being used commercially or are being used for research and development purposes. Some of the most commonly used nanomaterials for electronic and electrical equipment are carbon nanotubes and quantum dots and, in the case of surface coatings, nanoparticles of silver. 
 
This report investigates some of the current uses of nanotechnology by the electronics industry and briefly explores what is known so far about the toxicity of relevant nanomaterials.
