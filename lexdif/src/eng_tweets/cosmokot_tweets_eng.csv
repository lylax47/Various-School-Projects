kolibi1977 I had only hour of play because of that yesterday 
great shots very beautiful
Im kidding of course All peeps Im the gym should be nice and caring just like him and it was very sweet of him to ask beforehand
Now that Im recognized as a person who uses such weights its important to establish the hierarchy to never stand in line for a bench press
I just reached the next level of acceptance in the heavy weights zone a guy asked for my permission to grab a pair of 14kg dumbbells 
acht_bits sounds like a really good idea And it could be hard too Being insider the game and checking the phone at the same time
Southern Germany friends please report about your safety The news reports are horrifying
acht_bits it could become a new cheating method Finding a person who hacks who like that ofc if youre in each others friends list
acht_bits its terrible I just saw the report about four people dead Stay safe yourself
acht_bits I was talking about new missions we all like them DZ isnt the only place with good  guns and gear anymore
Missions are fun though Eliminating high value targets is my fav thing now
Tbh I cant recommend The Division to anyone especially my friends With my 219 gear score I die like a helpless puppy when Im alone in DZ
acht_bits acht_bits how was it Everything is ok
acht_bits never thought about using it like that but I loved playing against ctOS operators back then Good app for Aiden haters xD

You dont fucking steal mine or my friends items in DZ  especially now when they are so hard to come by

People ask a lot about finding motivation Heres what I can tell u  I have 0 motivation today and a fucked up ankle but gym is my therapy
Then I had to fight my way to the extraction area from DZ06 to DZ04 escape another Rogue team and LMB squad and fear for the rope to be cut
I had to do it alone as the game decided to separate me from my teammate I was shot by Rogue was revived by random kindly soul god bless
TheDivision is so insanely dangerous after the new update that I take looting and extracting 240 gear score item as my personal achievement
I wouldnt lie if I say that backday  is my hardest trainingday I have on my weekly schedule 
Itll take 40 more minutes fck Not saving New York tonight

My gf suggested to change my PSN nickname to cookiecat instead of keksballs ahaha no stupid questions but no fun also
Zoe_Volf but its not like you can decide for someone right How can you possibly know whether they are ready or not
Is it true that if you are not ready to be honest with someone you probably dont value them enough
I do believe Id murder someone for a hot latte right now SAME HERE TheDivision this game knows whats up 
ah shes so cute I almost feel bad for letting her wonder in the DZ and deal with all the bad guys xD
Even my agent has facial skin flaws thats a nice touch TheDivision PS4share

Seeing friends play when youre at work is the biggest negative attribute of PlayStation apps 
A face mask with a rice wine extract It really smells like the beverage and thats the only alcohol I can afford now lol
being a Rogue makes me more nervous than running away from them xD when the whole DZ is after you its better to have a high lvl
tbh it doesnt hurt to go rogue as a part of the group especially when you yourself dont shoot anyone
Some people tend to go Rouge just to get XP for surviving it I had no idea before I played with some high leveled peeps
I played with a girl from Italy whose route in the Dark Zone goes throughout the whole area from DZ01 to DZ06 Now shes got some balls 
People I like to team up with in TheDivision  Germans Russians Japs Americans People I cant play with for shit  Brits Francs 
I love how me and Peter are not wearing jackets while acht_bits and kolibi1977 are still not into spring mood xD
Im happy we could play all together finally gives me good memories about the very beginning and how hard it was back then

acht_bits oh yeah tnx I went to check for it and its for lvl 50 only

Im not even talking about the emerald stuff Like how did you guys get it The emerald holster I mean
Evening in the Dark Zone brought me a Brit and two new items with a nice gear score But still no 182 score holster The fuck
Overwatch is so overadvertising itself in my feed I actually start to think that I might give it a try

F0xDude the guy I workout with hes a big fun of TV series like Game of Thrones Hannibal or Teen Wolf but says that games are for nerds

On the other hand I didnt come to that gym to play it safe I know I should be out of my comfort zone to succeed But a lot of buts
Taking in account my current mental condition and the fear of pain that is waiting for me I actually consider to decline the offer
Thats some great news but I talked with my coach and he said that my current training intensity is nothing compared to what he plans

Told him that we cant be friends because he needs to eat right after the workout and I need to wait for half an hour
This adorable lad is going to be the death of me I shouldnt really make any jokes in his presence
In other words  its time for another exhilarating workout with no regrets about eating a damn piece of pie Go for it

acht_bits its always more complicated than it sounds People have their right to think different and chances are I can change it somehow
Welp not like I can do anything about my friends and relatives being homophobic heavy sigh

acht_bits count me in I was about to suggest it anyway xD
Also Quite has a lot more fanservice scenes than it was announced Yes its Kojima but somehow it makes the plot less serious in my eyes
I already dont like that system with getting coins to build your Mother Base because game offers you to buy them at PlayStation Store
wanna go home and play Metal Gear heavy sigh wont be able to touch it before the weekend though
acht_bits had the same thought This game is already cruel enough Im glad we dont see other kids suffering
"RT konamieu Kept you waiting uh

acht_bits I checked and I cant purchase it too I had it before my game crushed for the first time since I accidentally won the table
Were in the cafe and I took the table in front of the glasscase to watch the cakes while I drink my sugarfree coffee 
Looking good is never easy Since I was asked to share my current progress so here have todays 
acht_bits on the other hand I understand that Damien is nothing but a plot device and he somehow helps to understand Aidens personality
acht_bits sometimes he acts like a rejected ex I found his my boy form of address and how hes ordering Aiden around slightly disturbing
F0xDude what happened
Lol compared to Germany the rest of Europe is soooo expensive Now I understand why Germans always complain about it in France and Holland
Found another two train tickets from our trip to Amsterdam stashed in my wallet It means we spent more than 100 euros solely on transport
acht_bits so yes as I expected practice makes perfect Need to try harder but thats just a boring and really complicated trophy
acht_bits was it hard for you to win against that Pawnee guy in drinking game I cant get the trophy because of him
acht_bits I have five too but I dont remember anything about that one Ill check tomorrow
acht_bits I wonder if I have it already since I won once How many bikes do you have in your purchase list
acht_bits no not really Had to Google the rules and won only once Is that bike really worthy
acht_bits why or what for do you even need this Damiens confusing remarks are not enough xD
acht_bits I saw two guys kissing in Pawnee

Who was playing Watch Dogs until 2am and overslept her alarm clock going off That girl Now on the run trying to be in office on time

I need to find time to upload all my recent hacks on YouTube and twitch some of them were really hilarious
Why all my male friends have girly avatars in online hacking Its so cruel to kill girls Aiden knows no regrets though xD

acht_bits ahaha sorry I dont know what to do when being hacked by friends We dont lose points anyway
acht_bits nice try pal XD havent been hacked in a while
acht_bits for some reason I see you disconnected from the stream
acht_bits are you already done hacking for today
acht_bits they dont lose anything so I wont call it punishment But additional points are nice anyway
acht_bits thats some nice news here Also I noticed that now you get points if a hacking target quits the session
acht_bits I feel you man I sent a message to Ubi team when my game kept crushing down but now I just make saves
acht_bits same here Lost my notoriety points twice
acht_bits yes on Twitter But that happened only on anniversary and several weekends before that some months ago
acht_bits points like that are so rare now I miss the days when game was giving double notoriety for hacking
acht_bits tried once and failed He is such a good player I dont dare to approach him lol
lol the game just suggested for me to hack no fucking way haha
One unsuccessful hack always ruins the mood
But made it up to 86 anyway and he was a real Strong one haha
Failed to hack 400 points player because I was so busy making a run for my hacking spot I totally forgot about cameras in the area

the other person who likes Rose and Raidens family So Im just how come man
wow I just Im speechless I surely appreciate their contribution into fandom but thats just crazy
seriously their art and comic translations are everywhere they posted a fuckload of theories and claim to be fandoms expert
How its possible to be a huge fan of something and never consider spending more time with a thing you like so much I cant get it
Lol I found out that a very popular blogger in MGR fandom never played the game oo so things like that happen not only in cosplay huh
acht_bits yours is better So we basically look as the same lumberjack guy in each others games xD
And I guess no cheat meal for me on Sunday sads
Okay now I need to decide which products I can throw away from todays ration This little pie will cost me additional 20 minutes on cardio
